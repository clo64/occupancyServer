How to use the room API:
API JSON Layout:

1. Acepts POST to create a room. Must send Room_Number, Floor and preferably 
   an empty Occupant_RFID array. A different API will be used to populate 
   the array.
   API location /api/room/add
   POST API JSON Layout
   {
       "Room_Number": "1",
       "Floor": "1",
       "Occupant_RFID": []
   }
   If a room and floor number already exist, expect JSON response: "Room already exists"
