How to use the employee API:

1. Employee API is used to add or remove an employee. Duplicate employee
   names are allowed; the RFID is used as key value, and therefore Duplicate
   RFID values are NOT allowed.

   add employee API location: /api/employee/add

    add POST API JSON layout:
    {
        "Employee_Name": "Name Here",
        "Floor_Authorization": ["1"],   Converted to arrauy
        "Room_Authorization": ["1"],    Converted to array
        "RFID_Number": "12345"
    }

    If employee with RFID tag already exists expect JSON response:
    "RFID already assigned"

    If employee with no matching RFID tag, new employee record will be created

2. Remove employee requires only the RFID number associated with tha
   employee to remove the entire record.

   remove employee API location: /api/employee/remove

   remove POST API JSON layout:
   {
       "RFID_Number": "12345"
   }
