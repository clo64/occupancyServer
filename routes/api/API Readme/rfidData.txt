How to use the rfid data API:

1. Accepts POST containing an RFID tag number, a Room Number and a Floor Number.
   The function performs a .find on the Room database to locate the Room on the 
   Floor in question. It then loads the Occupants array of RFID numbers. If
   the RFID number in the request is located in the array, it removes it; assuming
   that the person is exiting the room. If it is not located in array it add the value
   assuming that the person is entering the room.
