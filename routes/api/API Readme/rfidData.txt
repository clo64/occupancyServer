How to use the rfid data API:

1. Accepts POST containing an RFID tag number, a Room Number and a Floor Number.
   The function performs a .find on the Room database to locate the Room on the 
   Floor in question. It then loads the Occupants array of RFID numbers. If
   the RFID number in the request is located in the array, it removes it; assuming
   that the person is exiting the room. If it is not located in array it add the value
   assuming that the person is entering the room.

   rfid API location: /api/rfiddata

   POST API JSON layout
   {
       "Room_Number": "1",
       "Floor": "1",
       "Rfid": "1"         //Inconsistent use of Rfid identifier, update this use case later*
   }
   The value 1 is a placeholder for any similar number.

Changes made to interaction/reaction of rfidData post. The module has been updated
to support validation of the incoming RFID tag.
The rffiData module will now validate the inbound RFID tage number coming in through the POST
api route. First, it will check if an RFID tage number already exists in the particular room array.
If it does, no validation necessary, simplly remove the RFID number from the array; as someone is 
leaving the room.
If the RFID number is NOT already in the room's rfid array, the module goes through the following
steps and responses:

If the RFID number is not assigned to an employee, json response:       "RFID Not Assigned"

If the RFID number is assigned to an employee, but not authorized to 
enter the room in question:                                             "Not authorized"

If the RFID number is assigned to an employee, and authorized to enter: "Rfid added"
