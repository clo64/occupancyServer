How to use the thermal data API:

1. Two methods to GET thermal data. 
   You can get all therma data by 
   sending the above JSON and making the All field == "1". The other 
   parameters can be any valid values.
   You can get the thermal data for a particular room on a Floor
   by sending the above json format specifying the room# and floor#
   of interest.

   thermal data API location: /api/thermaldata

   GET API JSON layout
   {
	   "Room_Number": "3",
	   "Floor": "1",
	   "Thermal_Occupants": "4",
	   "All": "0"
   }
   Room not found returns: "No room, or floor match"

2. Method to POST thermal data
   To create data for a room that does not exist, the
   CreateNew field should == "1". Otherwise send the data field 
   that you would like to update for the specified Room number and 
   floor combination.

   thermal data API location: /api/thermaldata

   POST API JSON Layout
   {
	   "Room_Number": "3",
	   "Floor": "1",
	   "Thermal_Occupants": "4",
	   "All": "0"
   }
